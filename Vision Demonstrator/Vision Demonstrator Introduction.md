## Vision Demonstrator

To better demonstrate the possibilities of Dataspaces and their management, this Vision Demonstrator was created. It's purpose is to showcase a possible user interface that would enable end-to-end interaction - all the way from joining a dataspace to being able to publish a new data asset for others to consume. 

Dataspaces Management is a complex topic and we assume that not everything visualized here will be correct and that is absolutely ok. In other words, this vision could be right or wrong, and that’s the whole point of it. If it sparks conversation and curiosity, it's served its purpose, we believe that it would only lead to interesting tensions to design for in the future. 

## Scenarios
This vision was based on 7 scenarios that we believe are essential to managing a dataspaces. They are meant to be consumed in a linear way, however we have provided shortcuts, if the intention is to showcase just a single use case. These are the envisioned scenarios:

1. Manage my Dataspaces
2. Discover Data Shared by Others
3. Negotiate a Data Contract
4. Create a new Policy
5. Create a new Data Asset
6. Create a Data Contract
7. Review existing Data Contract and Manage Notifications

All these scenarios will be accompanied by a detailed walkthrough and an explations of the individual screens (tbd). In the current version we are providing the following artifacts:
